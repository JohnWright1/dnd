# Backstory

On a rare celestial night, when the stars aligned to form a radiant constellation that had not been seen in generations, Avery was born to human parents in the tranquil village of Drakenshire. The villagers spoke of the auspicious event as a blessing from the heavens, marking her as a child destined for greatness.

From her earliest days, Avery felt a deep connection to both the celestial and the earthly realms. Her parents, skilled in the ways of nature, taught her the secrets of the land: how to read the signs of the seasons, the songs of the wind, and the stories written in the patterns of the leaves. They nurtured her innate gifts, blending the wisdom of the earth with her celestial heritage, teaching her to harness the power of nature in her journey.

As she grew, Avery became a skilled guide, leading travelers through the verdant woods and rolling hills surrounding Drakenshire. Her ability to commune with the land and understand its rhythms set her apart. She knew which paths to take, where the hidden springs lay, and how to find safety in the embrace of nature. Yet, it was on her sixteenth birthday that her life would change forever.

That evening, as the celestial alignment returned to the night sky, Avery ventured into the forest, drawn by a powerful calling. Beneath the shimmering constellations, she discovered a sacred grove bathed in silver light, where the energy of the earth felt more potent than ever. In the center stood an ancient altar, its surface etched with runes of protection and guidance.

As she approached, a vision enveloped her: the spirits of the earth and sky whispered secrets of valor and duty, revealing her true path as a paladin. Empowered by this celestial vision, Avery accepted her destiny, vowing to protect the innocent and safeguard the natural world. She felt the essence of the earth surge within her, granting her divine powers to heal, protect, and fight against those who sought to harm the land.

Now, Avery roams the realms as a guardian of nature and a beacon of hope. With her shield adorned with symbols of the celestial night and her sword forged in the fires of her resolve, she stands ready to confront darkness wherever it appears. Guided by the wisdom of her parents and the spirits of the land, Avery seeks to unite her celestial heritage with her earthly knowledge, illuminating the path for those who wander in the shadows.
