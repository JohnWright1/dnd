# Backstory

Raised in a village in the mountains by parents who were medicine sellers. Parents travelled from time to time to sell medicine to other areas in need. Aukan would stay in a nearby monastery with a friend of the family whilst parents were away. There was a final trip from which parents would never return and nothing would be known of their disappearance.

The monastery would then raise Aukan and teach their ways to him. The family friend became a mentor. There was a strict training regime to teach discipline and train self defence should it be needed. Although, he often wondered about the disappearance of his parents and found it strange that nothing further had been discovered about them after all these years right into young adulthood.
