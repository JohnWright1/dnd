# Backstory

Adzak was raised in a tribe known as the Blood Guards, a strong and fierce clan situated within a deep forest. It's location was ideal due to the close proximity to villages, farms and towns which had little defenses to their raids and provided suitable cover to avoid detection. 

The tribe enjoyed the success taking the food generated from these farms meaning they did not have to focus on this.

Adzak was selected as a youth to participate in spars and duels with other young orcs and defeated them easily due to a force he was able to tap into when he was angry. His preferred weapon was a mighty great axe which many were surprised he could wield at the young age.

When he became of age, he was chosen to join a raiding party to get on the field experience with what would become his usual activity, raiding. 
The raid was a target in the mountains that belonged to the local city Tinkergarde, a small settlement that did not have much in the way of defenses.

The raid went smoothly, some might say too smoothly which did not come as a surprise to the inexperienced Adzak who believed he was better than the gnomes.
Due to his careless behaviour, he did not notice that this was a trap set by the gnomes to stop the raids altogether. 
The 4 man raiding party was subdued and captured in the blink of an eye, the gnomish traps and gadgets doing their work.

The raiding party were taken prison and brought to Tinkergarde to await punishment for their crimes.
They determined the best outcome would be to work in their mines to help them to realise that hard labour would teach them cooperation and peace. Of the 4 orcs, 1 refused which involved him being put to death.

Knowing this was the outcome, the other 3, including Adzak were forced to work the mines until they learned the values they hoped this would teach.

It was noted early from observation that Adzak would work harder and faster when provoked seeming to tap into the same rage he would use as a child. Knowing this, the mine overseer would look to irritate and provoke Adzak daily to get the most productivity out of him. This was kept secret from the council who first issued the punishment, not knowing that this technique would not teach the orc cooperation or peace. 

This lead to a resentment that burned deep inside for gnomes, to the point where just seeing the gnomes would enrage him thus the conditioning had worked for the gnomes and he would take his anger out mining away day after day.

Perhaps given time, and a new overseer the orc would be forgiven for his crimes, but under the current overseer this does not seem likely. Time will tell what awaits Adzak.

Imprisoned since he was 18 years old.
