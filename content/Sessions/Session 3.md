# Recap

In the centre of Phandalin, echoing through the town was a deep humming sound that could only be heard by Arabella, as she followed the sound she came across a silver gauntlet inscribed with an eye on the palm. 

Upon reaching forward and making contact with the gauntlet she was teleported away from her companions. She found herself kneeling at the feet of a giant figure that she could only assume was her deity Helm himself, he said: "Champion of Ravensong, Protectors of the Realm, Vanquishers of the evil. As is your promise, your assistance is required."

Suddenly she was once again teleported away but instead of back to her companions she found herself in a lush field full of friendly wild animals and lush forests as far as the eyes can see, she encountered a talking tree who made themself know as Sylvanus, The God of Wild Nature. 

They informed Arabella of an evil force that had perverted and twisted the natural form of some of their children. To the northeast of Phandalin in the Mountain's Toe Gold Mine there was an infestation of wererats created with the dark magic of Myrkul, the god of death & monsters. His request was simple, these creatures are now far beyond saving due to the powerful magic that Myrkul has used to create them, please release them from this suffering and misery. 

The party soon headed off to Mountain's Toe Gold Mine, fortunately as luck would have it.. a request had come through from Adventurer's Guild to escort a "Don-Jon Raskin" to the mine. He was an overseer who had been tasked to keep an eye on the mine and to check-in as contact had been previously lost with the mine.

Before fully making their way to the mine the corpses of six dead orcs could be found strewn across a hillside, it was clear from the battlefield that these orcs had attempted to test their luck against the young white dragon that had pushed them from their homes. From the sight that laid in-front of the party the orcs clearly had no chance in this encounter.

The party headed into the mine and quickly found themselves overrun with wererats.. after suffering some injuries including Arabella and Don-Jon Raskin being bitten they decided to rest before heading further into the mine to clear out the wererats. 

They picked off several wererats and their leaders before freeing several dwarves who were starving in the back of the mine. As a reward they were able to get out with a sack of ten fist-sized chunks of gold ore, and a pair of goggles know as the goggles of night.

After leaving the mine and parting ways with Don-Jon Raskin, the party rested up nearby the mine, during the night Arabella experienced a vision in her dream where she once again met up with Sylvanus who taught her of the curse that has begun inhabiting her body, a magic he was unable to remove but there others who may be able to assist. 

He granted her the wish of being able to speak to animals and soon she awoke back together with the party at the camp and told them of her situation.
