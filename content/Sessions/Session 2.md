# Recap

The party awoke to the news of a potential premonition from Auren, she had a vision of a great battle between demons and the mortal races, seeing herself, Arabella, Dorin and Elion taking part in this great battle.

Dorin revealed some details about his past and how it may relate to the premonition, something Auren seemed reluctant to pursue giving the chaos and danger she witnessed.

The party met Scott a member of the adventurers guild who notified them of an improvement to their rank.

After restocking supplies the group headed towards Butterskull Ranch. While on route the party encountered a group of horses in a nearby field, they successfully tamed the horses. 

Soon after they had their first encounter with the young white dragon. After the dragon dispatched one of the horses they were able to push the dragon away, making it clear to the dragon that they weren’t going to be an easy meal he lost interest.

En route to the ranch they encountered a cow which they were able to coax into following them to the ranch. 

Once they arrived at the ranch they were surrounded by the atrocities that the orcs had committed with several of the farmhands corpses burning inside a destroyed stables.

They were able to swiftly dispatch the orcs inside and outside the house before finding and rescuing Big Al, as a thanks for rescuing his prized cow and saving his life he rewarded the group with some mithril chain mail and he gifted his horses to the group.
