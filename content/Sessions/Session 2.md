	- After leaving the tavern a humming sound can be heard emanating from the centre of town that can only be heard by Arabella.
	- A silver gauntlet with an eye can be seen floating above the ground.
	- Upon touching the gauntlet, Arabella disappears in front of everyone
	- She opens her eyes to see a shiny large piece of metal in front of her that seems to take up most of her vision, stepping back you see that this piece of metal forms that of a giant boot.
	- Looking up you see a figure far greater in height than any building you've ever seen.
	- A voice is heard inside your head: "Champion of Ravensong, Protectors of the Realm, Vanquishers of the evil. As is your promise, your assistance is required.
	- A bright light far greater than anything you've ever created or seen fills your vision as you open your eyes, you look around and see as your surroundings change to a lush forest with birds flying over head and small animals in the nearby trees.
	- As you stand up and get your bearings you hear a voice beckoning: "You there! A child of Helm how fortunate! Welcome to Arborea"
	- Sylvanus, The God of Wild Nature
	- Request is to defeat the vermin created by the dark magic of Bane, the god of tyranny. He has been polluting and desecrating my offspring creating abominations and monsters.

	- Gets teleported back to the town afterwards.


# Recap

The party awoke to the news of a potential premonition from Auren, she had a vision of a great battle between demons and the mortal races. She saw herself, Arabella, Dorin and Elion taking part in this great battle.

Dorin revealed some details about his past and how it may relate to the premonition, something Auren seemed reluctant to pursue giving the chaos and danger she witnessed.

The party met Scott a member of the adventurers guild who notified them of an improvement to their rank.

After restocking supplies the group headed towards Butterskull Ranch. While on route the party encountered a group of horses in a nearby field, they successfully tamed the horses. 

Soon after they had their first encounter with the young white dragon. After the dragon dispatched one of the horses they were able to push the dragon away, making it clear to the dragon that they weren’t going to be an easy meal he lost interest.

Enroute to the ranch they encountered a cow which they were able to coax into following them to the ranch. 

Once they arrived at the ranch they were surrounded by the atrocities that the orcs had committed with several of the farmhands corpses burning inside a destroyed stables.

They were able to swiftly dispatch the orcs inside and outside the house before finding and rescuing Big Al, as a thanks for rescuing his prized cow and saving his life he rewarded the group with some mithril chain mail and he gifted his horses to the group.
