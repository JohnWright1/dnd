# Recap

The party initially met at the [[Adventurers Guild]] headquarters in Neverwinter. 

After being greeted by [[Lavender Elision]] they were put together as a team as is a requirement for low ranking members of the guild until they have proven their abilities.

She notifies them of the emergence of a young white dragon to the south near the town of [[Phandalin]] and for their first task she ask to head to [[Phandalin]] and aid the townsfolk as several monsters have been acting unusual in the territory following the emergence of the dragon. 

She notifies the group of a man named Harbin Wester who is the mayor of the town and should be their point of contact once they arrive into the town.

On route to the town they're ambushed by a group of kobolds, 1 mounted on a giant lizard, after swiftly dealing with the threat, despite Arabella's failed attempt at charming the giant lizard the party carried on to [[Phandalin]].

After meeting the unusual Harbin Wester they are able to quickly assist the town by saving a couple of dwarves inside a nearby ruins from a group of slimes

Defeated a mimic terrorizing a group of gnomes, as a reward they received a handful of magical items.

Most recently the party saved Adabra Gwynn, a midwife and apothecary who was under attack from a pair of manticores, grateful for their aid she gifted the party several potions of healing. 

The party convinced her it was best to move into town temporarily until things had calmed down, convinced she decided to setup shop in the northern section of [[Phandalin]].

The party after returning the Harbin were provided with a notice for aid as Orcs have attacked Butterskull Ranch, five miles to the east of Conyberry along the Triboar Trail.
