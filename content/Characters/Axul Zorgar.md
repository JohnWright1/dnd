### Secrets

An Ancient Gold Dragon who has lived for 850 years Axul Zorgar having achieved such massive hoards has begun to spend his time spreading his power and influence over the world. Having understood this is his best option to root out and defeat evil demonic corruption.

As such over time he has gifted many families with his draconic bloodline to increase the number of sorcerers in the world, often visiting orphanages or finding young in need to offer his gift.

He is the reason that [[Auren Raventhorn]] has her powers, Axul primary lair resides in the Thunder Peaks. Having heard commotion in the nearby village of [[Archwood]] he found Auren alongside her family which had been murdered by a band of roaming demons. 

After defeating the evil residing in [[Archwood]] and pushing the demons back into hiding, he decided to bestow her with his gift and took her to the city of [[Farview]] where he knew the a half-orc matron [[Elanor Craven]] who would look after the child.
