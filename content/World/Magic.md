Magic is not commonly seen in [[Erodar]]. In the modern day individuals who are gifted with arcane magic (sorcerers and wizards) are very secretive about their magic in an attempt to not draw attention to themselves.

As a replacement for magic [[Transcendent Crystals]] are used to cast basic magic.

### History

 Magic used to be far more common with wizards and sorcerers existing across the land with an arcane magic user existing in almost even the smallest of settlements, but those times are long gone and arcane magic is no where near as prevalent in the world. 

More wizards that exist are restricted to kingdoms.
