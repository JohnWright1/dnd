The adventuring guild of Neverwinter is the central adventuring hub on the sword coast, acting as the headquarters of the Faerun adventuring guild.

The adventuring guild accepts job from everyone, after approval from the guild these jobs are posted so that adventuring groups are able to take on such a task.

The guild requires that adventurers complete their tasks as part of a group, this is a rule that was brought in in recent years due to an increase in deaths of bronze rank adventurers unaware of the dangers in the wilds of Faerun.

The guild is uses a ranking system to help provide rough guidance to adventures on what adventures are available how difficult they are expected to be. This is for two reasons: 1 is to prevent the unnecessary deaths of adventure taking on challenges far beyond their skill levels and the 2nd is to maintain the reputation and quality of the guild for being able to complete such tasks.

The ranks are as follows;

1. Mithril
2. Gold
3. Iron
4. Silver
5. Bronze
6. Copper

The guild categorises different creatures, monsters and events based on the ranking system such as Copper relating to local town issues such as giant rats and the occasional goblin, while mithril could involve world altering creatures or events that may threaten Faerun as a whole and the way of lives of the average person.

Higher ranks in the guild are able to buy better equipment and have more access to missions and the higher status and wealth would allow you better opportunities to purchase property in the city of Neverwinter.
