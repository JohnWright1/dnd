# Details

Several leaflets were posted in the nearby villages requesting any available adventurers to head to the [[Golden Boar Tavern]] to meet with [[Dagrun Kragdigger]] to hear about a job to clear a group of goblins from a nearby mine.

"The Goblins around Tinkerville have grown significantly more confident with the appearance of a Hobgoblin by the name of Narstuf The Colossal. Their new found confidence has motivated them to take over the abandoned lower mine in the [[Gnomegarde Central Mine]]."

"We required adventures to enter the mines, dispose of the hobgoblin Narstuf The Colossal, returning with his head and then to blow the south entrance to the mines to prevent any further incursions from the goblins."

"You will be accompanied by [[Dagrun Kragdigger]] the overseer of the Central Mine to ensure that the mission is completed and to assist with blowing the south entrance. The completing party or individuals will be rewarded with 80 gold upon completion."
