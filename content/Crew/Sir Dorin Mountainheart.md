# Backstory

In the sacred halls of Mountainheart Sanctum, Sir Dorin Mountainheart, a devout dwarf paladin, and heir to the throne, stood as the beacon of righteousness within his noble family. His unwavering dedication to the holy ways has earned him the trust of both kin and community. 

However, his younger brother and sister, Bagril and Dunora, harboured resentment, lured by the whispers of a shadowy cult that sought to corrupt the sanctity of their ancestral home. Joining forces and betraying the family's sacred trust, Bagril, supported by Dunora, orchestrated a sacrilegious ritual within the sanctum, framing Dorin for heresy and removing him from the line to inherit the throne. 

Imprisoned and branded a traitor, Dorin endured the harsh judgment of his kin. Yet, guided by the divine light, he escaped captivity, discovering the malevolent forces manipulating his brother. Determined to cleanse his family's name and stop the evil from corrupting his once holy place and brother, Dorin embarks on a quest looking for help. 

Armed with his faith, a sacred oath, and the conviction to purify his bloodline, Dorin roams the land. He looks for any opportunity to further this goal, clear his name as well as uphold the values of which of his birth right.
