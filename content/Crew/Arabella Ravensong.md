## Backstory

Arabella is the daughter of Themalin and Wynra Ravensong, owners of several generous plots of land handed down through generations. 

Arabella is second in line to the throne, second to her brother - Elran. Her days growing up and through her youth were spent picking up whichever activity suited her fancy at the time - entertaining, gardening, alchemy. 

But none of these activities held her interest for long enough for her to ever gain adept skill in them. One of the latest activities whilst Arabella still lived in her family’s main residence was researching the history of the Ravensongs, and to her surprise, she found that throughout history, their success in keeping their land and fortune was down to several adventuring clerics, specifically those that worshipped the god of protection - Helm. 

After a recent attempt on hers and her family’s life for the sake of their fortune only saved by the nameless adventurer that had come and saved her, slaughtering the (goblins?) that had tried to attack, Arabella decided she and her family owed her thanks to Helm and began to worship him, devoting herself to help others less fortunate and weaker than her. 

Her family disagreed that this was necessary, saying they paid their dues and thanks through coin. However when Arabella was set on joining an adventuring guild, they begrudgingly allowed her as her brother was first in line.
