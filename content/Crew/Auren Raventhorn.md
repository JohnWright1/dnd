Was thinking for your backstory.. you never new about your draconic ancestry, you are an orphan who was taken in by a group of sailors. You've been between various sailing groups but could never keep with the same crew for too long as strange occurrences would start to happen to you as your magic started to flair up, which often involved fire or damage to ships or cargo in some way.

You met a dragonborn sorcerer named [[Axul Zorgar]] on an island you were working on who was able to teach you about your abilities, and helped you figure out your ancestry is related to a gold dragon blessing your family in the past From their after training with the sorcerer, you've decided your skilled enough to head out on your own and join an adventuring guild on the sword coast in Neverwinter after a recommendation by your mentor, that becoming an adventurer would be your best chance to improve your abilities and find out more about your family and ancestry
